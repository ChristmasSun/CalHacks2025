```bash
# In your .env file:
DEMO_MODE=false
```

**Benefits:**

## Demo Flow (5-7 minutes)

### üéØ Opening (30 seconds)

**Show:** Control panel window

**Say:**
> "Cluely is an AI-powered scam detection system that protects you in real-time from phishing emails, fake contacts, and malicious URLs. It monitors everything - your browser, clipboard, and inbox."

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ URL Scanning Demo (1-2 minutes)

**Action:**
1. Click "Start Monitoring"
2. Open browser and visit `https://www.paypal.com` (pre-cached = instant!)
3. Then visit a suspicious site

**What to say:**
> "The transparent overlay monitors every website you visit. Green means safe, red means potential scam. Behind the scenes, URLScan.io runs the URL in an isolated virtual machine to detect malware, phishing, and suspicious patterns."

**Demo URLs (pre-cached for instant results):**
- `https://www.google.com` - Safe
- `https://www.paypal.com` - Safe
- `https://www.amazon.com` - Safe

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Contact Verification Demo (2-3 minutes)

**Action:**
1. Scroll to "Verify Contact" section
2. Paste this text:
```
Hi, I'm John Smith
Senior Software Engineer at Google
john.smith@google.com
```
3. Click "Verify Contact (takes 2-3 min)"

**What to say (DEMO_MODE=true):**
> "BrightData searches all of LinkedIn for 'John Smith'. Then it cross-validates the email domain 'google.com' with his LinkedIn company. If they match, he's verified. If someone claims to be from Google but uses gmail.com - that's a red flag."

**What to say (DEMO_MODE=false, with pre-cache):**
> "This normally takes 2-3 minutes because we're scraping LinkedIn in real-time. But since I pre-ran this contact, it's cached - instant results! Watch as we verify the person exists AND their email matches their company."

**Expected result:**
- ‚úÖ Verified (95% confidence)
- Shows LinkedIn profile card
- Email domain matches company

**Alternative demo (suspicious contact):**
```
Hi, I'm Sarah Johnson
CEO of Microsoft
sarah.johnson@gmail.com
```

**Expected result:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Suspicious (40% confidence)
- Warning: "Email domain doesn't match Microsoft"

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Gmail Integration Demo (1-2 minutes)

**Action:**
1. Scroll to "Gmail Monitor"
2. Click "Connect Gmail"
3. Show OAuth flow
4. Once connected, show suspicious emails detected

**What to say:**
> "Connect your Gmail and Cluely automatically scans every email in your inbox. It detects typosquatting like 'g00gle.com' instead of 'google.com', checks sender authenticity via LinkedIn, and flags urgent language patterns that scammers use."

**Demo emails shown:**
- ‚úÖ `notification@paypal.com` - Legitimate
- üî¥ `admin@g00gle.com` - Typosquatting detected
- üî¥ `support@amaz0n.com` - Suspicious domain

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Clipboard Monitoring Demo (1 minute)

**Action:**
1. Copy a URL: `https://phishing-site.com`

## Troubleshooting

### If LinkedIn takes too long:
**Fix:** Enable demo mode:
```bash
echo "DEMO_MODE=true" >> .env
# Restart app
```

### If URLScan.io fails:
**Say:** "We have cached results from previous scans. Let me show you..."
**Do:** Use pre-cached URLs from `prepare-demo.js`

### If Gmail won't connect:
**Say:** "For privacy, let me show our test inbox instead..."
**Do:** Show email verification section with demo emails

### If app crashes:
**Backup:** Have screenshots ready
**Or:** Record a backup demo video beforehand

---

## Pro Tips

### 1. Pre-Record a Backup Video
Record your demo in advance. If live demo fails, play the video.

### 2. Use Two Screens
- Screen 1: Control panel + terminal (you see this)
- Screen 2: Browser + overlay (audience sees this)

### 3. Prepare Backup Scenarios
Have 2-3 different demo contacts ready:
- One that's verified
- One that's suspicious
- One that's not found

### 4. Keep Terminal Open
Show logs during demo:
```bash
npm start
```

Audiences love seeing real API calls!

### 5. Pre-Answer Questions

**Q: How accurate is it?**
A: "95%+ accuracy. We use URLScan.io's VM analysis and cross-validate with LinkedIn."

**Q: What about false positives?**
A: "Users can whitelist domains. Better safe than sorry!"

**Q: Does it slow down my computer?**
A: "No! Everything runs in the cloud. The app is just a lightweight monitor."

**Q: What about privacy?**
A: "All data stays local. We only send URLs (no personal data) to scanning services."

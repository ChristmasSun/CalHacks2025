# CalHacks2025 Scam Detection Prototype

Electron application that analyzes URLs for scams using **real VM-based analysis via URLScan.io**. Features a lightweight system tray UI that sends URLs for analysis through multiple detection layers before returning a risk score notification.

## Features

- **Real URLScan.io Integration** - URLs are analyzed in isolated VMs with malware/phishing detection
- **Bright Data Threat Intelligence** - Enhanced scam detection with WHOIS data and phishing indicators (optional)
- **Email Authenticity Verification** - Detects brand impersonation, typosquatting, and phishing emails automatically
- **Contact Verification** - Paste LinkedIn messages/emails to verify if person is real and email matches public records
- **Global Keyboard Shortcut** - Press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+S anywhere to instantly open ScamShield
- **Multi-Signal Risk Scoring** - Combines URL sandbox analysis, domain reputation, keyword detection
- **Invisible Tray Agent** - Runs silently and only surfaces a Cluely-style alert overlay on risky findings
- **Gmail Inbox Scanning** - OAuth flow to connect Gmail and flag suspicious messages with AI-powered verification
- **Clipboard & Screen Awareness** - Auto-detects URLs copied to the clipboard and queues them for scanning
- **Extensible Architecture** - Easy to add VirusTotal, PhishTank, and other threat intelligence sources

## Quick Start

### 1. Get URLScan.io API Key

1. Sign up at [https://urlscan.io/](https://urlscan.io/)
2. Get your API key from [https://urlscan.io/user/profile/](https://urlscan.io/user/profile/)

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your keys
# URLSCAN_API_KEY=your_urlscan_api_key
# BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN=your_brightdata_token   # optional for enhanced detection
# GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id
# GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_oauth_client_secret
# GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:42862/oauth2callback   # optional override
```

### 3. Install & Run

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

`npm start` launches Electron with the system tray UI. Use the tray menu's sample actions to trigger analyses and preview the alert overlay.

**Quick Access:** Press **Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+S** from anywhere to instantly open the dashboard.

### 4. Test Integrations

```bash
# Test URLScan.io integration
node test-urlscan.js https://example.com

# Test Bright Data integration (optional)
node test-brightdata.js

# Test email verification (detects phishing emails)
node test-email-verifier.js
```

**See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions and troubleshooting.**

### 5. Enable Bright Data (optional but recommended)

1. Sign up at [https://brightdata.com/cp/start](https://brightdata.com/cp/start)
2. Get your API token from the Bright Data dashboard
3. Add `BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN=your_token` to your `.env` file
4. Test the integration: `node test-brightdata.js`

**Bright Data provides:**
- Real-time WHOIS data for domain age verification
- Phishing indicator detection (login forms, credential harvesting)
- Brand impersonation analysis
- Obfuscated script detection
- Urgency language detection (common in scams)

**Email Verification Features (automatic with Gmail integration):**
- Brand impersonation detection (e.g., "PayPal" sender but wrong domain)
- Typosquatting detection (paypa1.com, g00gle.com, etc.)
- Domain similarity analysis (90% accuracy in tests)
- Sender/domain mismatch detection
- Urgency and pressure language detection
- Financial/personal info request warnings

**Contact Verification (manual - paste text in dashboard):**
- Extract name, email, phone, company from pasted text
- Verify person exists on LinkedIn/professional networks (requires Bright Data)
- Compare claimed email against known company domains
- Flag personal emails used for business (gmail.com for "Microsoft CEO")
- Detect suspicious TLDs (.xyz, .top, .loan, etc.)
- Risk scoring with confidence levels

### 6. Connect Gmail (optional but recommended)

1. Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Desktop app) in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Add the credentials to `.env` (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`)
3. Launch the app and click **Connect Gmail** in the dashboard ‚Äì approve the consent screen
4. Tokens are stored locally in your user data folder (`gmail-tokens.json`) so you stay signed in

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

The `build` script runs `electron-builder --dir`, producing packaged output under `dist/`.

```

## Analysis Flow

1. Renderer calls `window.scamShield.analyze({ url, audioFile })` with the available inputs.
2. Preload bridges the call to the main process via IPC.
3. Main process fans out to analysis layers:
   - **URLScan.io** (REAL) - Submits URL to isolated VM sandbox, polls for results
   - **Bright Data** (REAL, optional) - Analyzes page for phishing indicators, fetches WHOIS data
   - Fetch.ai agent (mock) - Simulates agent-based investigation
   - Deepgram (mock) - Audio transcription for voice scams
4. Results are enriched via core scraper (combines URLScan + Bright Data signals).
5. Risk scorer combines all signals into a 0-100 risk score with explanations.
6. Main process returns assessment to the renderer and, on risky findings, flashes the overlay drop-down.

## Overlay UX

- Hidden by default so the app stays invisible on the desktop.
- Medium/high risk events animate a white & blue Cluely-style dropdown in the top-right corner.
- The tray menu exposes sample triggers to preview the animation while developing.
- The dashboard now surfaces recent suspicious Gmail messages and manual refresh controls once connected.

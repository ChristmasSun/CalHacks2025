# URL History Fix - Risk Scores Not Being Saved

## Critical Bug Fixed

### Problem
When copying previously scanned URLs (especially unsafe ones), they would show as SAFE instead of their actual risk level. This was a **CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE** - dangerous URLs were being incorrectly marked as safe!

**User Report:**
> "now its saying that the previously unsafe urls are safe (when i copy it again). it shows that they are safe instead of unsafe"

### Root Cause

The `urlHistory.recordScan()` function was being called in the **wrong place** with the **wrong data**:

**File:** `src/core/scan-queue.js:116`
```javascript
// WRONG! This was being called with URLScan raw data, not the risk assessment
urlHistory.recordScan(url, result?.assessment);
```

The problem:
1. `inspectUrlInSandbox()` returns raw URLScan.io data (not an assessment)
2. Raw URLScan data doesn't have a `.assessment` field
3. So `result?.assessment` was always `undefined`
4. `recordScan()` would save entries with NO risk data:
   ```json
   {
     "url": "http://dangerous-site.com",
     "timestamp": 1234567890,
     "riskScore": undefined,  // ‚Üê Missing!
     "riskLevel": undefined,  // ‚Üê Missing!
     "summary": undefined     // ‚Üê Missing!
   }
   ```

5. When cached results were retrieved, there was no risk data to display
6. Code would default to showing "SAFE" (the default/fallback)

### The Fix

#### 1. Removed Bad Call in scan-queue.js
**File:** `src/core/scan-queue.js:115-116`

**BEFORE:**
```javascript
const scanDuration = Date.now() - scanStart;

// Record the scan in history
urlHistory.recordScan(url, result?.assessment); // ‚Üê WRONG DATA!
```

**AFTER:**
```javascript
const scanDuration = Date.now() - scanStart;

// Note: urlHistory.recordScan() is now called from orchestrateAnalysis()
// after the full risk assessment is complete, not here where we only have URLScan data
```

#### 2. Added Correct Call in main.js
**File:** `src/electron/main.js:694-698`

**ADDED:**
```javascript
// Record in URL history database (for caching - only if not already cached)
if (url && !assessment.cached) {
  const { urlHistory } = require('../core/url-history');
  urlHistory.recordScan(url, assessment); // ‚Üê CORRECT DATA!
}
```

This is called AFTER:
- URLScan.io has scanned the URL
- Data has been enriched with Bright Data
- Risk has been scored with `scoreRisk()`
- We have a complete `assessment` object with `risk_score`, `risk_level`, and `summary`

### What the Fix Does

Now the URL history correctly saves:
```json
{
  "url": "http://dangerous-site.com",
  "fingerprint": "abc123...",
  "timestamp": 1761446178625,
  "scanDate": "2025-10-26T02:36:18.625Z",
  "riskScore": 85,           // ‚úÖ Saved correctly!
  "riskLevel": "high",       // ‚úÖ Saved correctly!
  "summary": "Phishing site"  // ‚úÖ Saved correctly!
}
```

### Data Migration

**IMPORTANT:** Old URL history data is corrupted (missing risk scores). The fix includes clearing `url-history.json`:

```bash
# This was done automatically
echo "[]" > url-history.json
```

All previously scanned URLs will need to be re-scanned once to rebuild the cache with correct data.

### Testing

After the fix, test with an unsafe URL:

```bash
npm start

# Test 1: Scan an unsafe URL
# Copy: http://google.com.cust_login.ie
# Expected: Shows "HIGH RISK - 90%"

# Test 2: Copy the same unsafe URL again
# Expected: Shows "HIGH RISK - 90% üìã Cached" (NOT "SAFE"!)

# Test 3: Check url-history.json
cat url-history.json
# Expected: Contains riskScore, riskLevel, and summary fields
```

### Verification

To verify the fix is working, check that `url-history.json` now contains:
```json
[
  {
    "url": "...",
    "fingerprint": "...",
    "timestamp": ...,
    "scanDate": "...",
    "riskScore": 85,        // ‚Üê Must be present
    "riskLevel": "high",    // ‚Üê Must be present
    "summary": "..."        // ‚Üê Must be present
  }
]
```

### Why This Was Critical

This bug meant that:
1. ‚ùå Dangerous phishing sites would show as "SAFE" after first scan
2. ‚ùå Users would trust malicious URLs based on cached (but wrong) data
3. ‚ùå The core purpose of the app (scam detection) was broken for cached results

After the fix:
1. ‚úÖ Risk scores are correctly saved to cache
2. ‚úÖ Cached results show accurate risk levels
3. ‚úÖ Dangerous URLs remain marked as dangerous
4. ‚úÖ Security is maintained across all scans

### Files Modified

1. **`src/core/scan-queue.js:115-116`**
   - Removed incorrect `urlHistory.recordScan()` call
   - Added comment explaining why

2. **`src/electron/main.js:694-698`**
   - Added correct `urlHistory.recordScan()` call
   - Called with proper assessment data
   - Only saves non-cached results (prevents duplicates)

3. **`url-history.json`**
   - Cleared corrupted data
   - Will be rebuilt with correct data on next scans

### Impact

- **Security:** ‚úÖ Fixed critical security issue
- **Performance:** ‚úÖ No performance impact
- **Data:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires re-scanning URLs to rebuild cache
- **UX:** ‚úÖ Cached results now show correct risk levels

### Related Issues

This fix resolves:
- Issue #4 (completely) - Cached URLs showing wrong risk
- Completes the cached results feature properly
- Ensures consistency between fresh scans and cached results

### Next Steps for Users

1. ‚úÖ Update to this fix
2. ‚úÖ Clear old cache (done automatically)
3. ‚úÖ Re-scan any important URLs to rebuild cache with correct data
4. ‚úÖ Verify that unsafe URLs stay marked as unsafe

The app will now maintain security even when using cached results!
